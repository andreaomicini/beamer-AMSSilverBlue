# beamer-AMSSilverBlue — branch `cesena`

The old **AMSCesenaBleu** Beamer style, version 1.0 (RCS 2016/08/15), exactly as it was copied
into the WOA 2018 tutorial deck in June 2018: the ancestor whose colours `main` recovered. It is
not `main` and never merges into it.

It exists so that decks of 2016–2019 can be rebuilt as they were, pinned through their `.style`
submodule at the tag `cesena-1.0` — the first being `blockchain-woa2018minischool-slides`
(Doctorate Mini-School @ WOA 2018, Palermo, 27 June 2018). Source: the deck's own copy in
`~/Documents/presentazioni/2018/WOA 2018 Tutorial/slides/1/`, recovered on 2026-10-25; iCloud's
`Archivio/Documenti/prodotti/beamer/AMSCesenaBleu/` (2019) holds the same file without its RCS line.

The theme loads its seal as `img/almacesena-background`, so a consumer links
`img/almacesena-background.pdf` to `.style/almacesena-background.pdf`. The bibliography style of
the time was LaTeX's own `apalike`, not `apalike-AMS`.

Two tags, one per variant:

- `cesena-1.0` — the style as Andrea had it, loading the seal from `img/`.
- `cesena-1.0-ciatto` — Giovanni Ciatto's copy, used for his deck of 30 May 2018 (*A gentle
  introduction to the Blockchain and Smart contracts*, Autonomous Systems course), the seed of
  the tutorial: the seal from `./res/img/` (a consumer links `res/img/almacesena-background.pdf`
  instead), numeric labels in the bibliography (`\insertbiblabel`), and `\hhref` without its
  light twin `\hhhref`. The branch head carries this variant.
